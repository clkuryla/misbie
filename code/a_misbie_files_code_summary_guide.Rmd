# Background

MiSBIE

# Data

* Load raw data and format it appropriately: 
  * data_import_and_format_raw.Rmd
    * Save hr_raw, rr_raw, bp_raw

* Combine all three datasets and align them (for example, for TE calculations)
  * map_intervals_and_combine.Rmd
  
# Analysis

* Measures from single variable (only hr, rr, or bp)
  * single_variable_measures.Rmd
    * ApEn, SampEn, HRV/rsp, etc

* Transfer entropy
  * transfer_entropy.Rmd
  
* Comparing the measures from the previous Rmds to each other
  * comparing_measures.Rmd


# More  

* Simulations, tests, and sanity checks along the way
  * simulations_and_sanity_checks.Rmd
  
* Vignettes
  * vignette_rhrv.Rmd
